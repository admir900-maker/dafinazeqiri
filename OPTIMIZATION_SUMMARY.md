## üìä Performance Monitoring Tools

### 1. Performance Monitor Class (`src/lib/performance.ts`)
- Function execution time measurement
- Async operation monitoring
- Performance statistics collection
- Automated performance reporting

### 2. Database Optimization Script (`scripts/optimize-database.ts`)
- Automated index creation for all collections
- Performance analysis tools
- Collection statistics monitoring

## üîß Available Scripts

```bash
# Test optimization setup
npm run test:optimization

# Optimize database indexes (requires MONGODB_URI)
npm run optimize:db

# Build with bundle analysis
npm run build:analyze

# Run complete optimization suite
npm run optimize

# Analyze performance metrics
npm run analyze:performance
```

## üöÄ How to Run Database Optimization

### Prerequisites
You need to set up your MongoDB connection string in one of these ways:

1. **Add to .env.local file** (recommended):
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/biletara
   # or for MongoDB Atlas:
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/biletara
   ```

2. **Set as environment variable**:
   ```bash
   set MONGODB_URI=your_connection_string
   npm run optimize:db
   ```

3. **Pass directly as argument**:
   ```bash
   npm run optimize:db -- --uri="your_mongodb_connection_string"
   ```

### Running the Optimization
```bash
# First, test that everything is set up correctly
npm run test:optimization

# Then run the database optimization
npm run optimize:db

# Or run the complete optimization suite
npm run optimize
```

## üìà Expected Performance Improvements

### Database Queries
- **Events API**: 60-80% faster due to lean queries and aggregation
- **Ticket Availability**: 70-90% faster with single aggregation query
- **Category Filtering**: 50-70% faster with compound indexes

### Frontend Performance
- **Component Rendering**: 30-50% faster due to memoization
- **Bundle Size**: 15-25% reduction through tree shaking and code splitting
- **Image Loading**: 40-60% faster load times with optimized formats and caching

### API Response Times
- **Featured Events**: Expected sub-500ms response times
- **Event Details**: 30-50% faster load times
- **Search Operations**: 60-80% improvement with text indexes

## üéØ Database Indexes Created

### Events Collection
```javascript
{ date: 1 }                           // Date-based queries
{ category: 1, date: 1 }             // Category + date filtering
{ title: "text", description: "text", ...} // Full-text search
{ location: 1 }                      // Location filtering
{ venue: 1 }                         // Venue queries
```

### Bookings Collection
```javascript
{ eventId: 1, status: 1, paymentStatus: 1 } // Ticket availability
{ userId: 1, createdAt: -1 }               // User bookings
{ paymentIntentId: 1 }                     // Payment processing
{ bookingReference: 1 }                    // Reference lookups
```

### Categories Collection
```javascript
{ slug: 1 }    // Unique slug queries
{ name: 1 }    // Name-based searches
```

## üîç Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Monitoring
1. **Database Performance**: Run `npm run analyze:performance` monthly
2. **Bundle Analysis**: Run `npm run build:analyze` before major releases
3. **Memory Usage**: Monitor client-side memory with performance tools
4. **API Response Times**: Track with performance monitoring

### Recommended Actions
1. **Index Maintenance**: Re-run optimization script after schema changes
2. **Cache Tuning**: Adjust cache TTL based on usage patterns
3. **Bundle Optimization**: Regular dependency audits and updates
4. **Performance Budgets**: Set performance budgets for key metrics

## üöÄ Next Steps for Further Optimization

## üìã Testing Recommendations

### Performance Testing
1. Test with bundle analyzer to ensure optimization effectiveness
2. Use Chrome DevTools to measure Core Web Vitals
3. Test API endpoints with realistic data volumes
4. Monitor database query performance with explain plans

### Load Testing
1. Test with multiple concurrent users
2. Verify database connection pooling under load
3. Monitor memory usage during peak operations
4. Test cache effectiveness with repeated requests
